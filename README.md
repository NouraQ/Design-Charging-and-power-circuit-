# Design-Charging-and-power-circuit-
In this project, I pick the battery that will provide me with the longest time off work while costing the least amount of money, and then I design a charging and power circuit. Bring a battery, a DC motor, a power supply, a diode, a led, and a resistor. Begin by connecting the negative part of the battery to the negative part of the power supply and Terminal2 in the DC motor, then connect the positive part to the cathode in the Diode and Terminal1 in the DC motor. The negative part of the power supply is connected to the cathode in the led, and the positive part is connected to the anode in the diode and terminal 1 in the resistors. Finally, connect the anode in the LED to terminal 1 in the resistor.
